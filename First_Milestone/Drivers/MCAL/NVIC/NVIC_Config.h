/**
 * @brief Maximum NVIC Interrupt Priority
 *
 * This macro defines the highest priority level that can be assigned to an
 * interrupt in the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC). Interrupts
 * with higher priority values have lower actual priorities. It is a
 * user-configurable setting.
 *
 * @note This macro is intended for use with the MCAL_NVIC_xSetPriority function
 *       which sets both group and sub-group priorities. If you are using the
 *       MCAL_NVIC_vSetPriority function which sets group and sub-group priorities
 *       separately, consider using the PRIORITY_GROUPING macro instead.
 *
 * @note The valid range for NVIC interrupt priorities is from 0 to (NVIC_MAX_PRIORITY).
 *       The highest priority is 0, and the value specified by this macro represents
 *       the maximum numerical priority value achievable.
 *
 * @note The number of possible interrupts in the NVIC is (NVIC_MAX_PRIORITY + 1).

 * You can choose one of these options to configure how interrupt priorities are grouped.
 *
 * @attention These macros are intended for use with MCAL_NVIC_vSetPriority and should not
 * be used with MCAL_NVIC_xSetPriority.

 * - NVIC_8GROUP_2SUB :  8 subgroups with 2 bits for sub-priority.
 *     - Group Priority Range: 0 to 7
 *     - Sub-Priority Range: 0 to 1
 * - NVIC_4GROUP_4SUB :  4 subgroups with 4 bits for sub-priority.
